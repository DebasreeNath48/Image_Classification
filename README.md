# Image_Classification
<b>Note :</b> This is just a sample demonstration of image classification.

Here, the complete cifar10 dataset is not used, only 20,000 training images and training labels, and 4000 testing images and testing labels are used.

Hence, the prediction may vary. It is recommended to use the complete dataset for training the model. 

As well as 10 epochs are assigned in this project, it is recommended to increase the number of epochs as well.
